# What is omnipy?

![rileylink android raspberrypi](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy/raw/master/img/droidrlpi.jpg)

Omnipy is a set of hardware and software components that allows users of the Omnipod insulin pump to automate insulin delivery using [Android APS](https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/EN/). Android APS is a long established artificial pancreas system with support for many different insulin pumps, but does not (yet) officially feature Omnipod support. Omnipy bridges this gap and brings Omnipod to Android APS.

Omnipy evolved from my initial efforts on working with OmniPod and is released to public as of February 2019. It has grown over time with support and feedback from the community.

Read the [introduction](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy/wiki) page on the wiki for more information.

## Omnipy v1.4 released

This release features the long awaited pod activation and basal schedule changes and comes with a brand new way of installation on the raspberry pi.

[Download](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy/releases/tag/v1.4) the latest version here.

Please refer to the [Setup documentation](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy/wiki/Setup-and-Configuration) on the wiki for information on how to set up the latest version of omnipy and the [Release Notes](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy/wiki/Release-Notes) for more information on release contents.

## Important information from the author

As of omnipy v1.4 release, **all development activities on omnipy is stopped**. The project is considered feature-complete and stable enough for general use.

Unless a major issue is encountered, there will be no fixes or updates to the current release. Support will still be available in the same form as it has been until today. If anyone is interested in taking the project further in its current form, [get in touch](mailto:barisk@gmail.com).

## Next up: OmniCore

I will focus all development efforts related to Omnipod and Omnipod Dash on [**OmniCore**](https://github.com/winemug/OmniCore), an OmniPod focused software product with a broader scope involving multiple platforms, hardware components and surprise features.

Today, I'm excited to announce that the very first milestone of OmniCore is going to _replace omnipy completely_ to address one particular complaint all omnipy users (including myself) have had so far: Having to carry a raspberry pi and a power supply.

**All of the omnipy functionality has already been ported** and the first release is scheduled to arrive _very_ soon. Keep an eye on the [OmniCore](https://github.com/winemug/OmniCore) github page for a status update in the coming days.
